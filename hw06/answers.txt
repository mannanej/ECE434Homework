1. Where does Julia Cartwright work?

    Julia Cartwright works at National Instruments

2. What is PREEMT_RT? Hint: Google it.

    PREEMT_RT is a real time kernal patch

3. What is mixed criticality?

    Mixed Criticality is when systems might run different types of jobs, like real/non-real time required jobs

4. How can drivers misbehave?

    Drivers can misbehave because they are shared between real/non-real time tasks

5. What is Î” in Figure 1?

    Delta is the latency between a event and the real time task execution

6. What is Cyclictest[2]?

    Cyclictests measure the time between a threads intended wakeup time and the time it actually wakes up

7. What is plotted in Figure 2?

    Figure 2 is a histogram plot for PREEMT and PREEMT_RT latencies

8. What is dispatch latency? Scheduling latency?

    Dispatch latency is the amount of time between the hardware firing and the interupt happening
    Scheduling latency is the amount of time it takes for tasks to be scheduled

9. What is mainline?

    Mainline is a model of the systems threads being run

10. What is keeping the External event in Figure 3 from starting?

    The external event is kept from running by the long running interupt handler

11. Why can the External event in Figure 4 start sooner?

    It reduces latency by letting more important tasks get threads first
