This code will implement a text based version of Etch-A-Sketch on a 9x9 grid.
The grid starts with '.' in the blank spots and places a 'X' where the pen is.
You can move the pen with WASD and clear the screen with C.
Due to the way the program reads inputs, you must hit ENTER after every input to update the screen.
