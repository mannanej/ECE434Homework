For the start of this homework, I started by adding a project to the project list on Teams. I hope that updated to the one on the Moodle page? I didn't seem to have access to the Modle page one. The project I added was a Type 1 Diabetic Blood Sugar Monitor. It would go to a webpage and download an excel sheet of my recent sugars. It would then take that excel sheet into python, do some math on it, and display it on either some LEDs or an LCD.

My make file works and makes app.arm and when run, prints Hello World. Then, the files get removed when using make clean.

The hello.ko file now says Hello and Goodbye to EddieMannan.

The gpio_test.c file is set to use two buttons, two LEDs, and use the make file.

I think the Homework 5 file says that this qualifies as a C, and I think that would be best concidering how far behind I am with my computer dying and all.
